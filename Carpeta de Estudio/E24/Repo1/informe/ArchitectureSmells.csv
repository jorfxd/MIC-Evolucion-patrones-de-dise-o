Project Name,Package Name,Architecture Smell,Cause of the Smell
criptoExchangeApplication,com.globant.application.config,Unstable Dependency,The tool detected the smell in this component because this component depends on other components that are less stable than itself. This component depends on following less stable component(s): com.globant.application.services.wallet; com.globant.application.services.authentication; com.globant.application.services.exchange
criptoExchangeApplication,com.globant.application.config,Feature Concentration,The tool detected the smell in this component because the component realizes more than one architectural concern/feature. Independent sets of related classes within this component are: [ApplicationCache; Cache; DefaultServiceBuilder; Initializer; ServiceBuilder; ExchangeInitializer]; [Boot]. LCC (Lack of Component Cohesion) = 0.29
criptoExchangeApplication,<All packages>,Dense Structure, The tool detected the smell because all the analyzed components exhibit excessive and dense dependencies among themselves.
