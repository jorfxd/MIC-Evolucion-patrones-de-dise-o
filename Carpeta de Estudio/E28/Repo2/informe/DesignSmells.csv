Project Name,Package Name,Type Name,Design Smell,Cause of the Smell
SistemaUrbanizacion-main,proyecto.clases,Permiso,Insufficient Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class becuase the class has bloated interface (large number of public methods). Total public methods in the class: 31 public methods
SistemaUrbanizacion-main,proyecto.clases,Reporte,Unutilized Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class is potentially unused. (Please ignore the smell if the reported class is auto-generated and/or used to serve a specific known purpose.)
SistemaUrbanizacion-main,proyecto.clases,Sistema,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: urbanizacion; visitantes; residentes; colaboradores; permisos; scene; ICON
SistemaUrbanizacion-main,proyecto.controllers,ColaboradoresController,Imperative Abstraction,The tool detected the smell in this class because it looks like that an operation is turned into a class. This class contains only the following public method: initialize
