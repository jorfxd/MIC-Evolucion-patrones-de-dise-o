Tetris-master,org.psnbtech,BoardPanel,Deficient Encapsulation,The tool detected the smell in this class because the class exposes fields belonging to it with public accessibility. Following fields are declared with public accessiblity: serialVersionUID; COLOR_MIN; COLOR_MAX; BORDER_WIDTH; COL_COUNT; VISIBLE_ROW_COUNT; HIDDEN_ROW_COUNT; ROW_COUNT; TILE_SIZE; SHADE_WIDTH; CENTER_X; CENTER_Y; PANEL_WIDTH; PANEL_HEIGHT; LARGE_FONT; SMALL_FONT; tetris; tiles
Tetris-master,org.psnbtech,BoardPanel,Cyclically-dependent Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because this class participates in a cyclic dependency. The participating classes in the cycle are: SidePanel; Tetris; BoardPanel; TileType
Tetris-master,org.psnbtech,TileType,Broken Modularization,The tool detected the smell in this class because it contains only data members without any method implementation. Following fields are declared in this class: baseColor; lightColor; darkColor; spawnCol; spawnRow; dimension; rows; cols; tiles
